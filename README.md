## Starting the container

Just the basics to get the container running:

```shell hl_lines="4 5 6 7 8 9"
docker run --rm \
    --name jellyfin \
    -p 8096:8096 \
    -e PUID=1000 \
    -e PGID=1000 \
    -e UMASK=002 \
    -e TZ="Etc/UTC" \
    -e ARGS="" \
    -e DEBUG="no" \
    -v /<host_folder_config>:/config \
    hotio/jellyfin
```

The [highlighted](https://hotio.dev/containers/jellyfin) variables are all optional, the values you see are the defaults.

## Tags

| Tag                | Upstream                      |
| -------------------|-------------------------------|
| `release` (latest) | Releases                      |
| `nightly`          | Every commit to master branch |

You can also find tags that reference a commit or version number.

## Configuration location

Your jellyfin configuration inside the container is stored in `/config/app`, to migrate from another container, you'd probably have to move your files from `/config` to `/config/app`. The following jellyfin path locations are used by default.

```shell
JELLYFIN_CONFIG_DIR="/config/app"
JELLYFIN_DATA_DIR="/config/app/data"
JELLYFIN_LOG_DIR="/config/app/log"
JELLYFIN_CACHE_DIR="/config/app/cache"
```

You can override these locations by setting them to a different value with a docker environment variable.

## Hardware support

To make your hardware devices available inside the container use the following argument `--device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri` for Intel QuickSync and `--device=/dev/dvb:/dev/dvb` for a tuner. NVIDIA users should go visit the [NVIDIA github](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) page for instructions. For Raspberry Pi OpenMAX you'll need to use `--device=/dev/vchiq:/dev/vchiq -v /opt/vc/lib:/opt/vc/lib`, V4L2 will need `--device=/dev/video10:/dev/video10 --device=/dev/video11:/dev/video11 --device=/dev/video12:/dev/video12` and MMAL needs `--device=/dev/vcsm:/dev/vcsm` or `--device=/dev/vc-mem:/dev/vc-mem`.

## Executing your own scripts

If you have a need to do additional stuff when the container starts or stops, you can mount your script with `-v /docker/host/my-script.sh:/etc/cont-init.d/99-my-script` to execute your script on container start or `-v /docker/host/my-script.sh:/etc/cont-finish.d/99-my-script` to execute it when the container stops. An example script can be seen below.

```shell
#!/usr/bin/with-contenv bash

echo "Hello, this is me, your script."
```

## Troubleshooting a problem

By default all output is redirected to `/dev/null`, so you won't see anything from the application when using `docker logs`. Most applications write everything to a log file too. If you do want to see this output with `docker logs`, you can use `-e DEBUG="yes"` to enable this.
